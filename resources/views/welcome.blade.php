                    <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-700">Laravel Folio is a powerful tool designed to simplify routing in applications developed using the Laravel framework. With Laravel Folio, generating routes becomes as easy as creating a Blade template within your application's resources/views/pages directory.</p>

                    <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-700">Laravel Folio is a page-based router that streamlines the process of defining and managing routes in your Laravel application. Unlike traditional routes that are defined in route files, Laravel Folio allows you to create routes directly through Blade templates. This provides an intuitive and efficient way to organize and manage your application's routes.</p>
